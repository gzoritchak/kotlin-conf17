This project is the support of the Kotlin Conf presentation "Frontend Kotlin from the trenches"
It contains:

  - a DSL for creating a presentation (common)
  - a javascript runner (js-runner)
  - the content of the Kotlin Conf presentation (examples/conf)

### How do I get set up? ###
Just run ./gradle build from project's root.

You can then open the files inside examples/kotlin-conf-js:

- index-dev.html : the require.js version of project
- index.html : the production version.
